# which frontend framework to use?

# decision
use deno + next.js

# discussion
node.js vs deno.js
-> deno.js (I've never used deno before, so I'd like to give deno a try.)

next.js vs remix -> next.js(I want to try out react-query later, but since remix covers features similar to react-query, I'm choosing next.js.)
